## A Webpage Created From Self-Learned Skills & Deployed Before Attending Formal Training

My very first webpage & a project that sits close to my heart, this was my first attempt at coding a webpage from scratch. I spent many hours researching & trial-and-erroring different ideas. Quickly learning how a computer reads files, I was able to take concepts learned during my Coding Bootcamp Prework modules & intergrate them into this page's user interface. Rather than have a bunch of scattered projects from this prework, I decided to create one project that would showcase everything I was able to learn before the first day of formal training.

With absolutely no prior experience of coding, this webpage is a wonderful example of my ability to problem solve & self-motivate so that I am able to create quality products that do not lend a hint to my minimal experience. The only notable sign of a rookie is that all HTML, CSS, & Javascript is in one file - it's sweet to look back at my lack of experience but also, my ability to apply many complex new concepts!

During these prework assignments, I learned a lot about myself. I realized it's nearly impossible for me to do the bare minimum - I simply cannot turn in a project until I've added every feature possible to make it an aesthetically-pleasing & dynamic interface. I will always put in the hours necessary toward completing a quality project, no matter how many are beginning to add up. 

My challenge & greatest success was coming up with the idea of Javascript buttons as a way to present the band members to users. I utilized concepts learned during the short Javscript module & implemented this technique into a slideshow of sorts that would allow the user to connected with a dynamically-manipulated DOM. This was such a fun project to create & it gave me a firm foundation in web development that has contributed to my success during the program.
